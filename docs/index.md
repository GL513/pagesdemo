## About GL
Hello, my name is Gavin, also known as GL, and GL513 in online communitites.<br>
I've been a huge tech geek since I was 5, and I still am, helping others with their projects, such as [KeyMapper](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.github.sds100.keymapper&hl=en_US&gl=US) by [sds100](https://github.com/sds100/).<br>
I hope that one day I can develop my own apps, like KeyMapper, or [Shortcut Maker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=rk.android.app.shortcutmaker&hl=en_US&gl=US), especially since I literally always try to make things better :)<br>
I also have an awesome community of friends, like [Jambler](https://gitlab.com/jambl3r), [Noah](https://github.com/noahtheprogrammer), A.K.A. OKprogrammer, and dreamweaver, [Trollserver](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCljg1FH1B_ju2D_NfqAYjDw), and alot more people.<br>

Pages will be updated soon. Currently still a WIP...
